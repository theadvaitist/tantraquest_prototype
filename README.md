This is a puzzle game that is primarily intended for teaching students the logical structure of Nyaya syllogism as well as allowing them to learn about different Tantrayuktis.

## How to Play
- Each puzzle represents a Nyaya syllogism, which has five parts: Pratijñā (Proposition), Hetu (Reason), Udāharaṇa (Example), Upanaya (Application), and Nigamana (Conclusion).
- For every puzzle, one of these parts is missing. Four clues are shown, and your job is to:
  1. **Identify the missing Nyāya part** using the Tantrayukti clue and dropdown selector.
  2. Once you correctly select the missing part, you'll be able to pick the correct missing statement from multiple options.
  3. If you pick the right answer, the missing statement will be revealed and you'll earn points.
  4. Incorrect attempts provide feedback, but you can keep trying until correct.
  5. After answering all questions, you'll see your score and completion percentage. You can replay the quiz afterward if you wish.
